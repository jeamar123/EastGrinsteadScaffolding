				<h2>What are cookies:</h2>
				<p>We and our business partners collect information about your use 
of our website through cookies.  Cookies are information files stored on
 your computer, tablet or smartphone that help websites remember who you
 are and information about your visit.  Cookies can help to display the 
information on a website in a way that matches your interests.  Most 
major websites use cookies.</p>

				<h2>What cookies are used on this Website:</h2>
                <p>The cookies we and our business partners use on this website are broadly grouped into the following categories:</p>

				<p><strong>Essential</strong> – Some of the cookies on our website 
are essential for us to be able to provide you with a service you have 
requested. An example of this would be a cookie used to enable you to 
log into your account on the website or which allows communication 
between your browser and the website. Our cookie preference cookie 
described in the section "How can I reject or opt out of receiving 
cookies?" is also an essential cookie. You may not be able to use our 
website without these cookies.</p>
				<p><strong>Analytics</strong> – We use analytics cookies to helps us
 understand how users engage with our website. An example is counting 
the number of different people coming to our website or using a 
particular feature, rather than the total number of times the site or 
feature is used.  Without this cookie, if you visited the website once 
each week for three weeks we would count you as three separate users. We
 would find it difficult to analyse how well our website was performing 
and improve it without these cookies.</p>
				<p><strong>Social Sharing</strong> – We use cookies to allow you to 
share content directly on the social networking/sharing sites like 
Facebook, Twitter or Google+. Examples would be if you wanted to "like" 
or "tweet" about a business or product advertised on our website.</p>
				<p><strong>Interest-Based Advertising</strong> – You will have 
noticed that when you visit websites you will be shown adverts for 
products and services you may wish to buy. The money made by website 
owners for showing third party adverts on their websites often pays for 
the cost of running the website and therefore usually allows you to use 
the website without having to pay a registration or usage fee. We, like 
many businesses may place adverts for ourselves on a range of associated
 websites. However, to try and ensure that the adverts you see are 
relevant to you we use cookies to collect information about the types of
 things that interest you, for example websites you visit and the 
geography that you are based in. Having these cookies does not increase 
the number of adverts you will be shown, but simply makes the adverts 
you see more relevant.</p>

				<h2>How can I reject or opt out of receiving cookies?</h2>
				<p>When you first visited this website you will have been shown a 
message bar drawing your attention to the fact that this website uses 
cookies and inviting you to review this cookie policy to help manage 
your cookie preferences. If you do not manage your preferences despite 
this prompt a cookie preference cookie will be dropped confirming that 
you consent to us using the cookies detailed in this cookie policy, this
 cookie preference cookie will last for no more than 5 years.</p>
				<p>Please note that we can't always control third party cookies 
stored on your machine from our website and where this is the case you 
will need to visit the relevant third party's website directly to manage
 cookies stored on your machine by them. Please see our "Third Party 
Cookies" section below.</p>
				<p>If you want to reject cookies we use from this website you will need to:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>delete the cookies from your browser. Most browsers also allow 
you to prevent all or some cookies being stored on your machine in the 
future. For more information on how to delete or disable cookies from 
your browser please use the "help" function within your browser or 
alternatively visit www.allaboutcookies.org. By deleting our cookie 
preference cookie the next time you visit this website the cookie 
message bar will appear again inviting you to again reconsider your 
preferences; and/or</li>
					<li>if you only want to reject some or all of the third party 
cookies you will need to visit the relevant third party's website
